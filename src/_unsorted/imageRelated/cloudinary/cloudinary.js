    Implementation info:
    -  new Promise is used to handle the asynchronous nature of the cloudinary.uploader.upload function
        --> A promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved or rejected at some point in the future.
        --> The resolve and reject functions passed to the promise's constructor are used to fulfill or reject the promise respectively, depending on the outcome of the Cloudinary upload.
    - secure_url  is a unique URL generated by Cloudinary to access the uploaded image securely over HTTPS. The URL includes a signature, which ensures that only authorized users can access the resource.
